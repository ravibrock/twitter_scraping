Scripts to pull and analyze data using the Twitter API

## List of scripts

### Twitter catalog.py

Pulls a list of who a given user ID is following and analyzes which accounts are most followed by the people the specified user ID follows. Useful to see a "network" of people outside of just those who are followed, as well as to see which accounts are most likely to be closely related to those the user already follows.
